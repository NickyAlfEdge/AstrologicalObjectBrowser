# AstrologicalObjectBrowser
Final submission for my Advanced Java Module. Attained a grade of 85% overall.

- Key learning outcomes from this module were reflection, GUI development (Swing), Object Oriented design, project managament and development, and other Java libraries such as the List library.

## Objectives
The overall objectives of the module were to create a piece of software that could be used to iterate and search through a list of user configured files (Stars, Messiers, and Planets). These files and accompanying datatypes must be configured in a specific way for the browser to work, but required the need for the software to handle errors elegantly, informing the user where necesarry if an issue is to be encountered.
